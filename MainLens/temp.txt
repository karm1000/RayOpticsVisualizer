A lens is a transmissive optical device which focuses or disperses a light beam by means
of refraction. A simple lens consists of a single piece of transparent material, while a
compound lens consists of several simple lenses (elements),usually arranged along a
common axis. Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic, and are ground and
polished or molded to a desired shape. A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a
prism, which refracts light without focusing. Devices that similarly focus or disperse
waves and radiation other than visible light are also called lenses, such as microwave
lenses, electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses.

A lens is one of the most familiar optical devices for a human being. We have lenses in
our eyes and a good number of us supplement them with another set of lenses in our
spectacles. A lens is made of a transparent material bounded by two spherical surfaces.
The surfaces may be both convex, both concave or one convex and one concave. When the
thickness of the lens is small compared to the other dimensions like object distance,
we call it a thin lens Figure (18.18) shows several lenses and paths of a number of rays
going through them.
